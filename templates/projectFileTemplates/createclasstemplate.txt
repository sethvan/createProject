# Takes 2 arguments and both are mandatory.
# Relative path to directory where to place header file should be first argument.
# Name of class to be used should be second argument.
# First argument should always be at least `include` and if path contains subdirectories then the additional directory 
# hierarchy should already have been added to both the `include` and `src` directories before calling this script.

# IOW `./createclass include Player` will create `player.h` in `include` directory and `player.cpp` in `src` directory.
# But if you want to for example add a Vertex class to a `Shaders` sub-directory of your `include` then a subdirectory 
# with the name `Shaders` should already exist in both `include` and `src` before you call this script and the call
# for that would be `./createclass include/shaders Vertex`
